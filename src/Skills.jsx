                                <p>In my high school, there are selective courses for students. Once I entered my senior level (16–18 years old), I selected the Programming Language Selective Course, and this was where my coding journey began. The language taught in the course was C++, with a focus on competitive programming.</p>
                                <p>The course was quite difficult for me at the beginning, as it was completely new to me. I even struggled with variables and syntax, not understanding why so many of them were necessary. However, after spending some time on it, it became easier and easier. Slowly, I realized that the teaching pace was too slow for me, so I started self-learning new algorithms and problem-solving techniques by searching the web. I also became addicted to solving problems.</p>
                                <p>Solving a difficult problem is not easy. After coming up with an idea, I need to code it and try submitting the solution. But the thing is, I usually do not succeed on my first or second attempt. I have to consider edge cases, exceptions, and sometimes even rethink my entire approach. This process can be frustrating, but if I don’t give up, I feel incredibly proud when I finally see the green "ACCEPT" button, knowing that all the hard work was truly worth it.</p>
                                <p>Through this journey, I learned that persistence and a passion for problem-solving can turn any challenge into an opportunity for growth, and this mindset continues to drive me forward in both coding and life.</p>
